# YARA_Rules
YARA Rules created from malware samples analyzed. 




+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IMPORTANT TO READ BEFORE USING ANY OF MY RULES
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I work as a malware and security analyst and study malware on a daily basis however when I create a YARA rule I have a limited amount of samples to work with and I dont have a wide variety of enviornments to test the rule against, if you are going to use one of my rules please vet it against your own samples and enviornment first before putting it live.

My rules are open and free for everyone to use, the only thing I ask for is attribution.
